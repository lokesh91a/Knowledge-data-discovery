# In this problem, you will generate simulated data, and then perform
# PCA and K-means clustering on the data.
# (a) Generate a simulated data set with 20 observations in each of
# three classes (i.e. 60 observations total), and 50 variables.
# Hint: There are a number of functions in R that you can use to
# generate data. One example is the rnorm() function; runif() is
# another option. Be sure to add a mean shift to the observations
# in each class so that there are three distinct classes.



# (b) Perform PCA on the 60 observations and plot the first two prin-
# cipal component score vectors. Use a different color to indicate
# the observations in each of the three classes. If the three classes
# appear separated in this plot, then continue on to part (c). If
# not, then return to part (a) and modify the simulation so that
# there is greater separation between the three classes. Do not
# continue to part (c) until the three classes show at least some
# separation in the first two principal component score vectors.



# (c) Perform K-means clustering of the observations with K = 3.
# How well do the clusters that you obtained in K-means cluster-
# ing compare to the true class labels?
# Hint: You can use the table() function in R to compare the true
# class labels to the class labels obtained by clustering. Be careful
# how you interpret the results: K-means clustering will arbitrarily
# number the clusters, so you cannot simply check whether the true
# class labels and clustering labels are the same.



# (d) Perform K-means clustering with K = 2. Describe your results.



# (e) Now perform K-means clustering with K = 4, and describe your
# results.



# (f) Now perform K-means clustering with K = 3 on the first two
# principal component score vectors, rather than on the raw data.
# That is, perform K-means clustering on the 60 Ã— 2 matrix of
# which the first column is the first principal component score
# vector, and the second column is the second principal component
# score vector. Comment on the results.



# (g) Using the scale() function, perform K-means clustering with
# K = 3 on the data after scaling each variable to have standard
# deviation one. How do these results compare to those obtained
# in (b)? Explain.
